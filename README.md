<h2 align="center">Well, hi there! 👋🏾 I'm Afrifa. </h2>


I started my journey as an Android developer but I am now a huge fan of **Java Spring Boot** and **React JS**. I'm a published researcher and currently working as a Software Engineer at Accenture. I am always looking to improve my skill set, try new things, and consider myself a continuous learner in Tech.
