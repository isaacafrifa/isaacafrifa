# Isaac Afrifa
#### Well hello! 👋🏾 

I'm Afrifa and I'm into product development and photography. Started out as an android developer and now a huge fan of **Java Spring Boot** and **React JS**. I'm a published Researcher and hold an MSc in Software Engineering. Currently, working as a Freelancer and consider myself an 'eternal student' in this abyss we call Technology 🌍 .
